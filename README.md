## Workflow

### **Step 1: Data Preprocessing and Preparation**
1. Download and preprocess clinical trial data.  
2. Download and preprocess DRKG embeddings.  
3. Download and preprocess CDCDB triplets (drug combinations + condition).

---

### **Step 2: Embedding Training and Finetuning**
1. Train embeddings for drugs and conditions that do not already have DRKG embeddings.  
2. Finetune embeddings for all nodes.

---

### **Step 3: Model Training and Evaluation**
1. Split all triplets into:  
   - 80% training   (for model training)
   - 10% testing    (for hyperparameters selection)
   - 10% validation (for model validation)

---

### **Step 4: Final Model Evaluation**
1. Retrain the final model using all available triplets.  
2. Evaluate the final model on:  
   - drug combinations without known conditions from CDCDB  
   - triplets from the OncoDrug+ database
